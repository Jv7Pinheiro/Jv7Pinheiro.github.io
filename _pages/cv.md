Research Experience
======

In Computer Science
------
* **Tensor Decompositions**, Dr. Grey Ballard & Dr. Aditya Devarakonda, Summer 2023 – present
  * Developed, implemented, and benchmarked a new algorithm for Tucker decomposition, leveraging both MATLAB and C++/MPI on NERSC's Perlmutter supercomputer.
  * Contributed to the TuckerMPI library, integrating novel improvements for handling large-scale tensor decompositions on high-performance computing systems.

* **Fast Matrix Multiplication**, Dr. Grey Ballard & Dr. Frank Moore, Summer 2023 – present
  * Developed and implemented new numerical optimization methods for tensor decomposition to search for fast matrix multiplication algorithms with cyclic invariant structure.
  * Discovered several algorithms, including both previously known ones (validating our optimization methods) and new algorithms (contributing novel insights to the field).
  * Collaborating with mathematicians to explore the mathematical foundations of these algorithms, studying permutations and actions to improve efficiency and develop new variants.

* **Machine Learning & Computer Vision**, Dr. Paul Pauca, Fall 2022 – Spring 2023
  * Developed a machine learning algorithm to identify species of palm trees in drone imagery from Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil, leveraging computer vision techniques for automated recognition.
  * Contributed to environmental preservation efforts by providing valuable data to local agencies, aiding in the reduction of deforestation of endangered palm tree species.

In Education
------
* **Latin American Education**, Dr. Betina Wilkinson, Fall 2019 – Spring 2020
  * Collaborated with Dr. Wilkinson and fellow tutors to investigate the educational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on underprivileged Latin American students at Latino Community Services (LCS).
  * Conducted pre-pandemic baseline assessments on academic performance and self-perception, later shifting focus to analyze the pandemic's effects on education in communities represented by LCS.

* **Educational Computer Science**, Dr. Ali Sakkal, Spring 2023
  * Explored the methodology and best practices of conducting research in computer science as part of a dual research project within Dr. Paul Pauca's lab.
  * Investigated the research process in computer science, including problem identification, data collection, algorithm design, and result analysis, while performing hands-on machine learning research.
  * Conducted qualitative interviews with professors and postdoctoral researchers to gain insights into effective research practices and compiled findings into a comprehensive final report and presentation for the SES program
