Hello There!!! I am a first year PhD candidate at the department of Computer Science at Purdue University. My research interests come from the application of the areas of Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA) and High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the field of Tensor Computations and Tensor Decompositions. Though I am attempting to make a move to the field of Quantum Computing where I am rediscovering myself. 

Please feel free to dig around the website and learn more about me and my work. See if you can find some easter eggs!
